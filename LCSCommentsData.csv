Echo Fox vs. Team SoloMid / LCS 2019 Spring - Week 6 / Post-Match Discussion,"People are going to meme this game but you have to remember TSM's comp relies on their split pushers either Ryze(4-1 split) or Ryze and LB(1-3-1 split) have to be ahead. Good stuff from Panda and then Hakuo for their punish ganks top side to keep the Ryze down.

Due to the two top deaths + jungle and then bot death this gave EF more momentum and priority and they were able to get 2 ocean drakes right away and deny LB 2 blue buffs which put LB behind for a while(Mid game TSM was 3-4k behind in gold).

Closing out the game is also harder for TSM because EF has Tristana who can clear waves pretty fast and Zoe who can provide good zoning. TSM's siege is rather weak with only having Ez for that. LB isnt ahead enough to be considered. You can see this when they tried to group up and push through bottom and BB was just blown up and TSM had to retreat and reset.

The game probably ends quicker if LB could have been the one to apply pressure and the Ryze be with the team since TSM couldn't burn down Baron/Elder faster than EF could stop them, since LB dmg was meh compared to Ryze for objectives.

This game is just basically EF making a lot of good moves/calls in the early game and a lot of bad ones in the late game. TSM made one when they grouped up bottom and mainly their only mistakes were  micro(missed ults, poor ults) outside of that I think TSM played their comp pretty well. Akaadian played toward the topside because that was their win condition and BB pulled pressure constantly to him(micro mistakes on preventing deaths). Pretty much all on EF on knowing how to deal with this and TSM just doing their best to punish(2-3 towers vs 5 man bot for BB,  Baron, Elder,  the game).",94,0.033125472411186706,0.5001228269085412,Positive

Few thoughts about the game:

Akaadian got outjungled early pretty hard but made up for it with the Baron steal.

Fenix missed 4 out of the first 12 minions when he had the push. I thought he would just tilt off the face of the earth after that already.

Brokenblade with huge pressure on his shoulders and playing it out very respectably for a young player.

Zven waveclearing without dying was super important as well, even though they didn't really have good gapclose + lockdown onto him. Surprised he didn't go for QSS to deal with Zoe bubble's instead of Hexdrinker (when a successful Kennen teamfight flank would probably mean they lose the teamfight anyway).",32,0.17458333333333334,0.6102083333333332,Positive

Still, this design is awful either way. They should have never made it possible for mages to deal good damage on structures. Whole point was that ADC's were the structure killers.. Tristana even has E for structures and now Ezreal has W for it. So why the hell do mages kill a base so quickly.

While this worked vs Echo Fox (who looked better with Panda), it may not work versus better teams. 

&#x200B;

However, I'm glad to see more of TSM and have them play more in a macro-oriented way. Some things to take notice of - Bjergsen got the Void Staff early, right? I think this is interesting - keeps him relevant at all stages. Also, see Brokenblade's use of the blue elixir for the split push. I think this is underrated as elixirs can make a huge difference earlier in the game. Smart plays from TSM. Sloppy as fuck, and would certainly be crushed by stronger teams that *know* how to use a lead, but this is still smart play by TSM and I hope they keep improving.

4. Zven looked godly

5. Smoothie shot calling was evident, as a long time c9 fan you could tell wuere he was shot calling.  

Overall, this looked like the strongest C9 impact/contractz/jensen/sneaky/smoothie roster of baron postering, and the strongest TSM over every iteration, which was clean effecient gameplay, slowly methodically take everything the map, and bleed you out all game.

This TSM looks fucking SCARY.  The best part, they are not over confident with NO expectations.  

TL vs TSM is going to be fucking insane, they look like the 2 strongest teams thus far.  C9 being 3rd.",7,0.009803921568627463,0.546078431372549,Positive

BB played very well on his first LCS pro play debut. Living up to the hype.

Really glad to see Akaadian being able to play for TSM. Was let down when I heard he wasn't going to be on TSM and only for TSM academy. I honestly think he has potential just like Grig and that they can grow if given the chance. Akaadian hasn't really been on a top 3 roster like this or staff resources. I think he did pretty well.

Also Licorice and BB >>>>>> Impact, I don't want to hear it.  

Last hot take: Jensen is the most overrated player to ever play in NA LCS, he was never on Bjergsen's level except when his team was way better(2018 Summer). There has never been a midlaner in NA that was ever consistently as good as Bjergsen, and I think Jensen was just built up to be that via a narrative. The best players at Worlds were Licorice and Svenskeren.  

TL worked last year partially because there weren't as many strong teams and because all the gold got put into the one person on TL who can actually carry. Make more protect the Doublelift comps or lose to C9 or TSM in the finals(they are basically guaranteed finals because C9/TSM are on the other side of the bracket). As weird as this is to say, DL and CoreJJ deserve a way better team than whatever Impact and Xmithie are now.

&#x200B;

That said, the hate/flame for Deftly this game and split is pretty odd. Vayne early pick was not great, but whatever. He was solid last split on an awful team. It's pretty hard to showcase anything when you have Olleh as your support, who actually runs it down the majority of games.

&#x200B;

The casters did a great job on the replay explaining why it was so bad for him to step up to the Galio bush, no reason when Vayne was fine just collecting farm. He consistently has mistakes like this every single game that just toss the lane in the gutter. What is Deftly supposed to do when his support sabotages him every single game?
