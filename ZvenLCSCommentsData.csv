100 Thieves vs. Team SoloMid / LCS 2019 Spring - Week 7 / Post-Match Discussion,"Honestly I think despite our abyssmal early game and Zven getting caught out those 2 times we played this as well as we possibly could have.

BB: He got set soo far behind by that failed 2v2. Afterwards he absorbed a lot of Ssumday's pressure though and was mechanically solid.

Akaadian: Really bad play in the early game. Definitely need to look at our early game 2v2's top lane. He also kept us in the game with that baron steal though and his smites were in point.

Bjergsen: Honestly I think Bjergsen was the main reason we were able to win that game. He carried insanely hard and played pretty much a perfect game. He put out soo much pressure - consistently chunking out people, made Syndra a non-factor and found all the key picks when it mattered.

Zven: Played pretty well for the most part and put up huge dmg numbers. I think he was actually a bigger part of that comeback than one would realise. On the other hand he got caught out 2 times, being in quite questionable positions at times.

Smoothie: Except for the one death in the early game which cost quite a lot, I think he played well. Did a very good job of making sure to setup defensive vision and that we would not get completely shut out from the baron pit. 

Overall I am pretty impressed by our macro and composure. Knowing we can make these comebacks. I do not think we would have been able to make any of those comebacks happen last split. But our early game the last few games (minus the c9 one) is definitely concerning and something we need to focus on over the course of the next few weeks. That being said, I think we have the ability to play different drafts quite well and boX series will be good for our team. I have tremendous faith in our coaching staff to fix the main problems we do have rn and by the time playoffs role around we will be a very scary team and can definitely contest with c9 and liquid!

Echo Fox vs. Team SoloMid / LCS 2019 Spring - Week 6 / Post-Match Discussion,"TSM's faces at the end of it say it all. Bjerg, Zven just with the biggest grins, they absolutely know what kind of a slugfest that game was. But they had no other option but to play it out like that.


Few thoughts about the game:

Akaadian got outjungled early pretty hard but made up for it with the Baron steal.

Fenix missed 4 out of the first 12 minions when he had the push. I thought he would just tilt off the face of the earth after that already.

Brokenblade with huge pressure on his shoulders and playing it out very respectably for a young player.

Zven waveclearing without dying was super important as well, even though they didn't really have good gapclose + lockdown onto him. Surprised he didn't go for QSS to deal with Zoe bubble's instead of Hexdrinker (when a successful Kennen teamfight flank would probably mean they lose the teamfight anyway).",32,0.17458333333333334,0.6102083333333332,Positive
