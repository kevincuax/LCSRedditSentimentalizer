They kept getting closer to even and then made a great call on baron. From there, they methodically took down flyquest with what seemed like exceptional shot calling. Such a great game to watch especially given how they have been playing for the past couple seasons. This team could be really scary if they keep improving \n",

Akaadian played toward the topside because that was their win condition and BB pulled pressure constantly to him(micro mistakes on preventing deaths).

I think this is interesting - keeps him relevant at all stages. Also, see Brokenblade's use of the blue elixir for the split push. I think this is underrated as elixirs can make a huge difference earlier in the game. Smart plays from TSM. Sloppy as fuck, and would certainly be crushed by stronger teams that *know* how to use a lead, but this is still smart play by TSM and I hope they keep improving. \n"

He was first to 3 items, 4 items, full build, first to 18, and yet he had almost no pressure. I don't know why he constantly kept running away instead of at least trying to take fights? The whole thing exemplified by one of the last teamfights where he ults AFTER his GA is down... You can blame Aphro and others for getting caught out and falling behind, but the people who get ahead have a huge responsibility in a team as well, and Ssumday did really poorly with his lead.
