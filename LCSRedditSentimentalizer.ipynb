That being said, I think we have the ability to play different drafts quite well and boX series will be good for our team. I have tremendous faith in our coaching staff to fix the main problems we do have rn and by the time playoffs role around we will be a very scary team and can definitely contest with c9 and liquid!\n",

I think this is underrated as elixirs can make a huge difference earlier in the game. Smart plays from TSM. Sloppy as fuck, and would certainly be crushed by stronger teams that *know* how to use a lead, but this is still smart play by TSM and I hope they keep improving. \n",

On that note Akaadian looks very uncomfortable on Nocturne. Sure he had good smite moments but his Nocturne ults were abysmal. Hopefully this is a one-off, and isn’t a consistent showing for TSM during playoffs. \n",

      "Overall I am pretty impressed by our macro and composure. Knowing we can make these comebacks. I do not think we would have been able to make any of those comebacks happen last split. But our early game the last few games (minus the c9 one) is definitely concerning and something we need to focus on over the course of the next few weeks. That being said, I think we have the ability to play different drafts quite well and boX series will be good for our team. I have tremendous faith in our coaching staff to fix the main problems we do have rn and by the time playoffs role around we will be a very scary team and can definitely contest with c9 and liquid!\n",
