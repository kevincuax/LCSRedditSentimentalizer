It almost feels like we are on the cusp of a renaissance for Jungling. I get the same feeling watching Tarzan play as I did when I first saw Faker step onto the scene in Season 3.

SK Telecom T1 vs. KT Rolster / LCK 2019 Spring - Week 8 / Post-Match Discussion,"Goodbye Telecom War, you have given me so many great memories ever since I started watching eSports. 

When I first began watching, it was 2010, and I was still really young and couldn’t really understand anything about StarCraft. All I could see was units being built and dying in fights around the map. 

But then, I fell in love with a certain player named FlaSh. He would always win, and him winning brought great joy to me. I would watch his matches just for the sake of watching him win, not because I wanted to watch his play. And through him, and teamliquid.net, I discovered the Proleague. Even though the foreign Brood War community was small compared to the Korean one, it was extremely passionate. The live report threads were always filled with hype and excitement. 

Then came the 2010 Proleague Finals, the first one I watched. It was SK Telecom against KT Rolster. And it was magnificent. KT managed to overcome SKT 4-2, with FlaSh winning the final game over HyuK in the final game. 

However, after that series, I was still not yet a KT fan. What made me one was the Proleague Finals the very next year. 

At the end of the 2010-2011 Proleague season, SKT were dominant and had received a direct seed to the finals whilst KT had a mediocre season and scraped into playoffs. But then, a win came for KT, then another one, then another. They managed to run the gauntlet all the way until the finals, and thus, the second Telecom War I watched began. 

It was a nailbiting final, going all the way to game 7. And out came FlaSh and BeSt (instead of Fantasy or Bisu). FlaSh, through a dominant display of his mechanics, overwhelmed BeSt and sealed the second Proleague title for KT in a row. As I watched them celebrate, I became a KT fan. 

The next time I would watch a Telecom War was again, in the 2012 S1 Proleague Finals. And it would be equally significant. It was the first telecom war that KT lost. It was heartbreaking. I remember being completely exhausted after  Bisu pulled out the match win against FlaSh in the ace match. 

During 2012, Kespa transitioned from Brood War to SC2, and I mostly watched SC2 tournaments instead of the monstrosity that was the hybrid Proleague. Whilst I did see KT and SKT players square off individually in tournaments, I didn’t watch their Proleague matchups. Thus the next time I came across the Telecom War was in a completely different game, League of Legends. 

Once again, it was the finals. KT Bullets vs SKT T1K. And once again, heartbreak as KT was reverse swept and Faker completed his ascendancy to become the World’s greatest midlaner. 

Meanwhile in SC2, SKT assembled a superteam, consisting of Rain, Parting, soO, INnoVation, Classic, Soulkey, all top players in the 2013-2014 SC2 scene. KT meanwhile, had middling players (except for FlaSh during the hellbat/parade push meta of 2013). But then in 2014, Zest burst onto the scene, fittingly during a Telecom War. Out of nowhere, he allkilled SKT and proceeded to dominate most of 2014, beating soO in the GSL finals as well. 

Then, the 2 telecoms met again in the finals of that year’s Proleague. That final was the most memorable telecom war for me ever. I recall watching as the LR thread ticked up to over 150 pages. The hype was humongous. It was not only a final that had a great storyline, it was a final that had fantastic games as well. FlaSh taking revenge on Parting and kicking a ball with SKT players’ name on it into the crowd, TY going 2 rax in the deciding game right into the nexus first by Classic. 

KT won that final 4-2, and I was ecstatic. 

In 2015, I started paying much more attention to League of Legends, and while I was a KT fan, I became a massive fan of Madlife and hence supported CJ mostly during 2015. The memorable Telecom War that year was one in the Summer Finals, where SKT 2015 transcended into their final form and proceeded to smash KT 3-0. It was sad, but I was moreso saddened that CJ didn’t make worlds. 

In 2016, the one telecom War that stood out to me was the one in the summer semifinals, where Score put on one of the finest individual performances a jungler could, and managed to drag KT back from the brink to reverse sweep SKT. It was also during this year that the Kespa teams in StarCraft all disbanded. It was a good run, now the torch of the telecom war will be carried on by LoL. 

The following year, as CJ was relegated, I finally reverted my attention back to the Telecom War and KT. That was also the year in which KT built their superteam, so I was really excited to see if this group of superstars can put SKT’s reign to an end. 

The first one was SKT vs KT in Spring. The “greatest best of 3 of all time” was a title given to it by many, and for good reason. It had everything, fantastic individual moments, team outplays, nexus rushes. (Faker’s 4 man orianna ult, Pawn’s zed etc) But the result made me sour, 2-1 SKT. Then, as fate would have it, SKT and KT once again meet in the finals, but this time, I wish it were as close as the bo3. SKT completely shut down KT and went on to the MSI. 

However, I was still optimistic going into Summer, KT was a new team, they could improve and win this time. But it wasn’t to be. Another 3-2 in the semifinals of LCK Summer 2017, another heartbreak. 

In 2018 and 2019, I cannot help but feel that the Telecom wars were winding down. In 2018, it was because SKT were a weak squad, and though I felt happy whenever KT won, it never had that intensity going into the match where I wouldn’t know who was going to win. In 2018, I expected KT to win. 

In 2019, it was the reverse, and with today’s 2-1 win by SKT and KT facing relegation and SKT a name change. It does feel like the end of an era of eSports. If KT by any chance gets relegated and disbands, the final old Kespa team would be gone. Though T1 would technically still be SKT, it would never feel the same again. The players would never have the label “SKT”. 

Still, despite the pessimism surrounding the future of the telecom war and KT, (Speaking from a nostalgic point of view.) the telecom war has given me and eSports so many fantastic memories, so many great moments, and in my eyes, will forever live on as the greatest rivalry eSports has ever seen.

* Mata played Tahm Kench mostly perfect and he was definitely the MVP for me that game. He was denying Blitz hooks, flanking isolated HLE members, cleanse flashing Gragas ult, etc
* Khan's positioning to threaten and flank was great. Kennen ult flank devastating as usual when executed properly
* Faker doing faker plays with LeBlanc toying with the enemy with the distortions and whatnot
*  I feel bad for Bono with that Gragas performance. I feel like he's not comfortable with that pick at all. I'm pretty sure some HLE fans (and maybe haters) will blame him for that loss.

Hanwha Life Esports vs. SK Telecom T1 / LCK 2019 Spring - Week 8 / Post-Match Discussion,"Really great games from basically everyone on SKT today. That first game seemed like a warmup and I'm glad they have the mental fortitude to come back from it.

With that said, I think the third game should have gone to Mata, but I don't necessarily think it was that far apart in performance.

Besides the stylish dodges, Faker played around the pressure that HLE were forming around mid. He escaped a ton of potential deaths from Blitzcrank and Gragas roams, both champions that can setup easy kills for a Yasuo. Even with all that pressure, he kept up with CS and let Khan have a free lane in a winning matchup.

Mata had great devours and clutch flashes, as well as that excellent roam to catch off Yasuo near dragon and to rotate for 2 tower trades when they gave up dragon. He played it extremely well, but I think it went to Faker because if Faker had managed to NOT feed that Yasuo, it would have opened the game up for Gragas to roam top and maybe dictate the flow of the game more.

Hanwha Life Esports vs. SK Telecom T1 / LCK 2019 Spring - Week 8 / Post-Match Discussion,"lol at the people saying khan should get mvp just because team setting everything up so perfectly for him to go in and easy ult.he definitely is the best top in LCK now seeing how 2nd round robin went.Too many people without game knowledge just always shouting names of the ones doing the flashy plays or getting kills while the others had been playing a perfect first 10-20mins of the game to let khan get to that point.Teddy mata and faker ate so much pressure and avoided all of the early skirmishes gragas and blitz tried to do.

The only MVP candidates for that game should be faker/mata.Faker : made the Yasuo&Gragas combo ineffective. (if you play mid lane in soloque and you meet this combo at op team,you will get smashed and tilted off the earth if no one helps your lane.even if they did ward for you,just by gragas being around mid lane zones you away from cs-ing.luckily faker is on Leblanc too)Poked and threatened flank many times after HLE's first mid tower fell causing them to team up and walk back to safety so many times making them out of position to contest or start anything. HLE's comp want to be the one picking fights or finding picks.if they can't do that,it just means SKT will be able to catch and kill or poke them out of contest.this game would had totally been different if Faker did died and thats a huge point imo cause then HLE would have taken mid towers and also force SKT to take a bad fight over objectives.

Mata : Super clutch devours that totally negated the only fight that seem like it would had swing or made the game equal in HLE's favor if they did kill mata and varus.(this point above is a huge factor for mvp debate but does it outweighs what Faker did? not entirely sure but for HLE to be in that desperate situation in the first place is definitely a by-product of what faker did to that Yasuo&Gragas combo in the early game.I had a feeling after their previous series of him getting dumpstered by this exact same combo against Bdd and Score.Faker probably got angry XD.poor Lava and Bono got the short end of the stick for trying the same move against him this time) +f
