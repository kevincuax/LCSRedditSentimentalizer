100 Thieves vs. Team SoloMid / LCS 2019 Spring - Week 7 / Post-Match Discussion,"An important win for TSM but a very poor showing in the early/mid game. Game was able to be prolonged with the abuse on Academy player Soligo who was able to hold his ground to a certain extent. Overall, a very poor game by both sides. On that note Akaadian looks very uncomfortable on Nocturne. Sure he had good smite moments but his Nocturne ults were abysmal. Hopefully this is a one-off, and isnâ€™t a consistent showing for TSM during playoffs. ",4,0.06495238095238094,0.5813544973544974,Positive

100 Thieves vs. Team SoloMid / LCS 2019 Spring - Week 7 / Post-Match Discussion,"Honestly I think despite our abyssmal early game and Zven getting caught out those 2 times we played this as well as we possibly could have.

BB: He got set soo far behind by that failed 2v2. Afterwards he absorbed a lot of Ssumday's pressure though and was mechanically solid.

Akaadian: Really bad play in the early game. Definitely need to look at our early game 2v2's top lane. He also kept us in the game with that baron steal though and his smites were in point.

Bjergsen: Honestly I think Bjergsen was the main reason we were able to win that game. He carried insanely hard and played pretty much a perfect game. He put out soo much pressure - consistently chunking out people, made Syndra a non-factor and found all the key picks when it mattered.

Zven: Played pretty well for the most part and put up huge dmg numbers. I think he was actually a bigger part of that comeback than one would realise. On the other hand he got caught out 2 times, being in quite questionable positions at times.

Smoothie: Except for the one death in the early game which cost quite a lot, I think he played well. Did a very good job of making sure to setup defensive vision and that we would not get completely shut out from the baron pit. 

Overall I am pretty impressed by our macro and composure. Knowing we can make these comebacks. I do not think we would have been able to make any of those comebacks happen last split. But our early game the last few games (minus the c9 one) is definitely concerning and something we need to focus on over the course of the next few weeks. That being said, I think we have the ability to play different drafts quite well and boX series will be good for our team. I have tremendous faith in our coaching staff to fix the main problems we do have rn and by the time playoffs role around we will be a very scary team and can definitely contest with c9 and liquid!

Echo Fox vs. Team SoloMid / LCS 2019 Spring - Week 6 / Post-Match Discussion,"People are going to meme this game but you have to remember TSM's comp relies on their split pushers either Ryze(4-1 split) or Ryze and LB(1-3-1 split) have to be ahead. Good stuff from Panda and then Hakuo for their punish ganks top side to keep the Ryze down.

Due to the two top deaths + jungle and then bot death this gave EF more momentum and priority and they were able to get 2 ocean drakes right away and deny LB 2 blue buffs which put LB behind for a while(Mid game TSM was 3-4k behind in gold).

Closing out the game is also harder for TSM because EF has Tristana who can clear waves pretty fast and Zoe who can provide good zoning. TSM's siege is rather weak with only having Ez for that. LB isnt ahead enough to be considered. You can see this when they tried to group up and push through bottom and BB was just blown up and TSM had to retreat and reset.

The game probably ends quicker if LB could have been the one to apply pressure and the Ryze be with the team since TSM couldn't burn down Baron/Elder faster than EF could stop them, since LB dmg was meh compared to Ryze for objectives.

This game is just basically EF making a lot of good moves/calls in the early game and a lot of bad ones in the late game. TSM made one when they grouped up bottom and mainly their only mistakes were  micro(missed ults, poor ults) outside of that I think TSM played their comp pretty well. Akaadian played toward the topside because that was their win condition and BB pulled pressure constantly to him(micro mistakes on preventing deaths). Pretty much all on EF on knowing how to deal with this and TSM just doing their best to punish(2-3 towers vs 5 man bot for BB,  Baron, Elder,  the game).",88,0.033125472411186706,0.5001228269085412,Positive
Echo Fox vs. Team SoloMid / LCS 2019 Spring - Week 6 / Post-Match Discussion,"TSM's faces at the end of it say it all. Bjerg, Zven just with the biggest grins, they absolutely know what kind of a slugfest that game was. But they had no other option but to play it out like that.


Few thoughts about the game:

Akaadian got outjungled early pretty hard but made up for it with the Baron steal.

Fenix missed 4 out of the first 12 minions when he had the push. I thought he would just tilt off the face of the earth after that already.

Brokenblade with huge pressure on his shoulders and playing it out very respectably for a young player.

Zven waveclearing without dying was super important as well, even though they didn't really have good gapclose + lockdown onto him. Surprised he didn't go for QSS to deal with Zoe bubble's instead of Hexdrinker (when a successful Kennen teamfight flank would probably mean they lose the teamfight anyway).",34,0.17458333333333334,0.6102083333333332,Positive
